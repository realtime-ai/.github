# RealtimeAI 

Realtime Multimodel Agent Service.

The project consists of three main components:

- **AI SDK (WebRTC)**: Captures and processes audio and video streams on the client side using the WebRTC protocol, including tasks such as audio/video encoding and preliminary inference.

- **WebRTC Gateway**: Manages signaling, handles NAT/firewall traversal, and forwards media streams. It also supports load balancing with the AI Service.

- **AI Service**: Provides real-time inference and data processing capabilities, including speech recognition, image recognition, real-time subtitle generation, speech synthesis, and interactive real-time large model interactions.
